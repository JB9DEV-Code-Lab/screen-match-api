# Screen Match API

This project was created to follow a Spring Boot project from Alura course. The goal is to follow as it is, with some
personal touches like English oriented (since it's a Brazilian course it's originally in portuguese), and some other
preferences while programming, but the generaral application idea is going to be the same for the v1.0.0. Any new
feature or idea I implement after the v1.0.0, I'm going to follow the semantic version pattern, by increasing the
version.

The project itself is a simple REST API using Spring Boot and Maven, to build an API that simulates a stream application
back-end.
